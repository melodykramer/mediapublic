Hi Mel,

I want to contribute, and feel free to rearrange as you see fit. I'm just sharing some of my initial thoughts and research. I'm also doing some research on my own on employee engagement/distributed leadership so I may find some additional rabbit holes to go down.
One thing that I'm not doing is finding any traditional open source internet engagement strategies - you know more about that than I, and I figure you'll have that covered. I'm just looking to give you some different directions.

First: Volunteer Engagements with Non-profits
  Volunteer Engagement with New York Cares: http://gettingattention.org/articles/1429/volunteer-communications/13-steps-effective-volunteer-communications.html
    Valuable because they defined their membership segments and funnels, focusing on volunteerism
    Their stages: http://gettingattention.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/GRAPH_VES2.jpg
    I like the idea of mapping the journey, as wll as the 80/20 rule of how you may choose to focus on 20% of your audience and deepening their engagement.
